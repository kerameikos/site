Kerameikos.org is a collaborative project dedicated to defining the intellectual concepts of pottery following the tenets of linked open data and the formulation of an ontology for representing and sharing ceramic data across disparate data systems. While the project is focused primarily on the definition of concepts within Greek black- and red-figure pottery, Kerameikos.org is extensible toward the definition of concepts in other fields of pottery studies.

See the github account at [https://github.com/kerameikos](https://github.com/kerameikos), which contains repositories for the RDF data and the publication framework. This framework could be applied to other linked data thesauri.
